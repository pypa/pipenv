# PEEP-001: Pipenv Governance Model

**ACCEPTED**

Pipenv will be governed by a BDFL (Kenneth Reitz), and a board of maintainers (trusted collaborators to the project on GitHub).

☤

## BDFL Responsibility & PEEP Acceptance

The approval of future PEEPs is the responsiblity of the BDFL, unless they defer the decision–making to the trusted board of maintainers, for a given PEEP. The BDFL may write new PEEPs at any time.

## Trusted Maintainer Responsibility

-   Maintain Pipenv's already–established interface — prevent it from eroding.
-   Polish what already exists. Do not craft.
-   Enforce the PEEP process.

## Community Responsibility

-   Reduce the burden on the maintainers by not requesting new features or changes in functionality, unless by the PEEP process.
-   Avoid writing PEEPs, unless it seems absolutely neccessary, and in the best interest of the entire Python community.
-   Remember, all deltas are risks.
