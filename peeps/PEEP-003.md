# PEEP-003: Revocation of Power of BDFL

**ACCEPTED**

Pipenv will be governed by a board of maintainers (trusted collaborators to the project on GitHub), not a BDFL.

The BDFL retains his title, however, revokes himself of his powers.

PEEP approval will be determined by available members of the board of maintainers, in private or public channels.
