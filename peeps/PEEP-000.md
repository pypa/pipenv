# PEEP-000: Pipenv Enhancement Proposals

**ACCEPTED**

Pipenv Enhancement Proposals (PEEPs) will be used for proposing any changes to Pipenv's user–interface or intended functionality.

☤

This is the first PEEP. All non–insignificant changes to Pipenv will require a PEEP. The governance model for Pipenv, including the process for future PEEP acceptance will be defined in [PEEP-001](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/blob/master/peeps/PEEP-001.md).
