This tutorial walks you through installing and using Python packages.

It will show you how to install and use the necessary tools and make strong
recommendations on best practices. Keep in mind that Python is used for a great
many different purposes, and precisely how you want to manage your dependencies
may change based on how you decide to publish your software. The guidance
presented here is most directly applicable to the development and deployment of
network services (including web applications), but is also very well suited to
managing development and testing environments for any kind of project.

.. Note:: This guide is written for Python 3, however, these instructions
    should work fine on Python 2.7‚Äîif you are still using it, for some reason.


‚ò§  Make sure you've got Python & pip
------------------------------------

Before you go any further, make sure you have Python and that it's available
from your command line. You can check this by simply running:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python --version

You should get some output like ``3.6.2``. If you do not have Python, please
install the latest 3.x version from `python.org`_ or refer to the
`Installing Python`_ section of *The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python*.

.. Note:: If you're newcomer and you get an error like this:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> python
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
        NameError: name 'python' is not defined

    It's because this command is intended to be run in a *shell* (also called
    a *terminal* or *console*). See the Python for Beginners
    `getting started tutorial`_ for an introduction to using your operating
    system's shell and interacting with Python.

Additionally, you'll need to make sure you have :ref:`pip` available. You can
check this by running:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip --version
    pip 9.0.1

If you installed Python from source, with an installer from `python.org`_, or
via `Homebrew`_ you should already have pip. If you're on Linux and installed
using your OS package manager, you may have to `install pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`_ separately.

If you plan to install pipenv using Homebrew you can skip this step. The
Homebrew installer takes care of pip for you.

‚ò§ Installing Pipenv
-------------------

:ref:`Pipenv` is a dependency manager for Python projects. If you're familiar
with Node.js' `npm`_ or Ruby's `bundler`_, it is similar in spirit to those
tools. While :ref:`pip` can install Python packages, Pipenv is recommended as
it's a higher-level tool that simplifies dependency management for common use
cases.

Use ``pip`` to install Pipenv:

.. code-block:: python

    $ pip install --user pipenv



.. Note:: This does a `user installation`_ to prevent breaking any system-wide
    packages. If ``pipenv`` isn't available in your shell after installation,
    you'll need to add the `user base`_'s binary directory to your ``PATH``.

    On Linux and macOS you can find the user base binary directory by running
    ``python -m site --user-base`` and adding ``bin`` to the end. For example,
    this will typically print ``~/.local`` (with ``~`` expanded to the
    absolute path to your home directory) so you'll need to add
    ``~/.local/bin`` to your ``PATH``. You can set your ``PATH`` permanently by
    `modifying ~/.profile`_.

    On Windows you can find the user base binary directory by running
    ``py -m site --user-site`` and replacing ``site-packages`` with
    ``Scripts``. For example, this could return
    ``C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Python36\site-packages`` so you would
    need to set your ``PATH`` to include
    ``C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Python36\Scripts``. You can set your
    user ``PATH`` permanently in the `Control Panel`_. You may need to log
    out for the ``PATH`` changes to take effect.

‚ò§ Installing packages for your project
--------------------------------------

Pipenv manages dependencies on a per-project basis. To install packages,
change into your project's directory (or just an empty directory for this
tutorial) and run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd myproject
    $ pipenv install requests

Pipenv will install the excellent `Requests`_ library and create a ``Pipfile``
for you in your project's directory. The :ref:`Pipfile` is used to track which
dependencies your project needs in case you need to re-install them, such as
when you share your project with others. You should get output similar to this
(although the exact paths shown will vary):

.. code-block:: text

    Creating a Pipfile for this project...
    Creating a virtualenv for this project...
    Using base prefix '/usr/local/Cellar/python3/3.6.2/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6'

    Also creating executable in ~/.local/share/virtualenvs/tmp-agwWamBd/bin/python

    Adding requests to Pipfile's [packages]...
    P.S. You have excellent taste! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú®

.. _Requests: https://python-requests.org


‚ò§ Using installed packages
--------------------------

Now that Requests is installed you can create a simple ``main.py`` file to
use it:

.. code-block:: python

    import requests

    response = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/ip')

    print('Your IP is {0}'.format(response.json()['origin']))

Then you can run this script using ``pipenv run``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pipenv run python main.py

You should get output similar to this:

.. code-block:: text

    Your IP is 8.8.8.8

Using ``$ pipenv run`` ensures that your installed packages are available to
your script. It's also possible to spawn a new shell that ensures all commands
have access to your installed packages with ``$ pipenv shell``.


‚ò§ Next steps

Congratulations, you now know how to install and use Python packages! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú®

.. _proper_installation:

‚ò§ Fancy Installation of Pipenv
==============================

To install pipenv in a fancy way, we recommend using `pipsi <https://github.com/mitsuhiko/pipsi>`_.

Pipsi is a powerful tool which allows you to install Python scripts into isolated virtual environments.

To install pipsi, first run this::

    $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitsuhiko/pipsi/master/get-pipsi.py | python

Follow the instructions, you'll have to update your ``PATH``.

Then, simply run::

    $ pipsi install pew
    $ pipsi install pipenv

To upgrade pipenv at any time::

    $ pipsi upgrade pipenv


This will install both ``pipenv`` and ``pew`` (one of our dependencies) in an isolated virtualenv, so it doesn't interfere with the rest of your Python installation!

.. _more_proper_installation:

‚ò§ Referentially Transparent Installation of Pipenv
==================================================

Nix provides atomic upgrades and rollbacks, it's reliable and reproducible thanks to keeping all dependencies isolated all the way down to libc.

`Once installed <https://nixos.org/nix/>`_ simply run::

    $ nix-env --install --attr pipenv

.. _pragmatic_installation:

‚ò§ Pragmatic Installation of Pipenv
==================================

If you have a working installation of pip, and maintain certain "toolchain" type Python modules as global utilities in your user environment, pip `user installs <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#user-installs>`_ allow for installation into your home directory. Note that due to interaction between dependencies, you should limit tools installed in this way to basic building blocks for a Python workflow like virtualenv, pipenv, tox, and similar software.

To install::

    $ pip install --user pipenv

For more information see the `user installs documentation <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#user-installs>`_, but to add the installed cli tools from a pip user install to your path, add the output of::

    $ python -c "import site; import os; print(os.path.join(site.USER_BASE, 'bin'))"

To upgrade pipenv at any time::

    $ pip install --user --upgrade pipenv

.. _crude_installation:

‚ò§ Crude Installation of Pipenv
==============================

If you don't even have pip installed, you can use this crude installation method, which will bootstrap your whole system::

    $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kennethreitz/pipenv/master/get-pipenv.py | python

Congratulations, you now have pip and Pipenv installed!
