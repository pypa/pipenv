**Pipenv** ‚Äî¬†the tool for managing application dependencies from `PyPA <https://www.pypa.io/en/latest/>`__, free (as in freedom).

Pipenv is a tool that aims to bring the best of all packaging worlds (bundler, composer, npm, cargo, yarn, etc.) to the Python world. *Windows is a first-class citizen, in our world.*

It automatically creates and manages a virtualenv for your projects, as well as adds/removes packages from your ``Pipfile`` as you install/uninstall packages. It also generates the ever-important ``Pipfile.lock``, which is used to produce deterministic builds.

Pipenv is primarily meant to provide users and developers of applications with an easy method to setup a working environment. For the distinction between libraries and applications and the usage of ``setup.py`` vs ``Pipfile`` to define dependencies, see :ref:`pipfile-vs-setuppy`.

The problems that Pipenv seeks to solve are multi-faceted:

- You no longer need to use ``pip`` and ``virtualenv`` separately. They work together.
- Managing a ``requirements.txt`` file `can be problematic <https://www.kennethreitz.org/essays/a-better-pip-workflow>`_, so Pipenv uses ``Pipfile`` and ``Pipfile.lock`` to separate abstract dependency declarations from the last tested combination.
- Hashes are used everywhere, always. Security. Automatically expose security vulnerabilities.
- Strongly encourage the use of the latest versions of dependencies to minimize security risks `arising from outdated components <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A9-Using_Components_with_Known_Vulnerabilities>`_.
- Give you insight into your dependency graph (e.g. ``$ pipenv graph``).
- Streamline development workflow by loading ``.env`` files.

Pipenv does not attempt to `package or distribute projects <https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/distributing-packages/>`_. For example, publishing to the `Python Package Index (PyPI) <https://pypi.org/>`_ cannot be done with Pipenv. Package dependencies will still need to be maintained independently from Pipenv.

Install Pipenv Today!
---------------------

Just use pip::

    $ pip install pipenv

Or, if you're using Ubuntu 17.10::

    $ sudo apt install software-properties-common python-software-properties
    $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:pypa/ppa
    $ sudo apt update
    $ sudo apt install pipenv

Otherwise, if you're on MacOS, you can install Pipenv easily with Homebrew::

        $ brew install pipenv

User Testimonials
-----------------

**Jannis Leidel**, former pip maintainer‚Äî
    *Pipenv is the porcelain I always wanted to build for pip. It fits my brain and mostly replaces virtualenvwrapper and manual pip calls for me. Use it.*

**David Gang**‚Äî
    *This package manager is really awesome. For the first time I know exactly what my dependencies are which I installed and what the transitive dependencies are. Combined with the fact that installs are deterministic, makes this package manager first class, like cargo*.

**Justin Myles Holmes**‚Äî
    *Pipenv is finally an abstraction meant to engage the mind instead of merely the filesystem.*

‚ò§ Pipenv Features
-----------------

- Enables truly *deterministic builds*, while easily specifying *only what you want*.
- Generates and checks file hashes for locked dependencies.
- Automatically install required Pythons, if ``pyenv`` is available.
- Automatically finds your project home, recursively, by looking for a ``Pipfile``.
- Automatically generates a ``Pipfile``, if one doesn't exist.
- Automatically creates a virtualenv in a standard location.
- Automatically adds/removes packages to a ``Pipfile`` when they are un/installed.
- Automatically loads ``.env`` files, if they exist.

The main commands are ``install``, ``uninstall``, and ``lock``, which generates a ``Pipfile.lock``. These are intended to replace ``$ pip install`` usage, as well as manual virtualenv management (to activate a virtualenv, run ``$ pipenv shell``).

Basic Concepts
//////////////

- A virtualenv will automatically be created, when one doesn't exist.
- When no parameters are passed to ``install``, all packages ``[packages]`` specified will be installed.
- To initialize a Python 3 virtual environment, run ``$ pipenv --three``.
- To initialize a Python 2 virtual environment, run ``$ pipenv --two``.
- Otherwise, whatever virtualenv defaults to will be the default.



Other Commands
//////////////

- ``graph`` will show you a dependency graph, of your installed dependencies.
- ``shell`` will spawn a shell with the virtualenv activated.
- ``run`` will run a given command from the virtualenv, with any arguments forwarded (e.g. ``$ pipenv run python`` or ``$ pipenv run pip freeze``).
- ``check`` checks for security vulnerabilities and asserts that PEP 508 requirements are being met by the current environment.
