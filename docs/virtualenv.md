## Custom Virtual Environment Location

Pipenv automatically honors the `WORKON_HOME` environment variable, if it
is set, so you can tell pipenv to store your virtual environments
wherever you want, e.g.:

    export WORKON_HOME=~/.venvs

In addition, you can also have Pipenv stick the virtualenv in `project/.venv` by setting the `PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT` environment variable.

## Virtual Environment Name

The virtualenv name created by Pipenv may be different from what you were expecting.
Dangerous characters (i.e. `` $!*@"` ``, as well as space, line feed, carriage return,
and tab) are converted to underscores. Additionally, the full path to the current
folder is encoded into a "slug value" and appended to ensure the virtualenv name
is unique.

Pipenv supports a arbitrary custom name for the virtual environment set at `PIPENV_CUSTOM_VENV_NAME`.

The logical place to specify this would be in a user's `.env` file in the root of the project, which gets loaded by pipenv when it is invoked.

## Renaming or Moving a project folder managed by pipenv
By default pipenv creates a virtualenv for your project and gives it a name. The default name is how pipenv maps the individual project to the correct virtualenv. Pipenv names the virtualenv with the name of the projectâ€™s root directory plus the hash of the full path to the project's root (e.g., `my_project-a3de50`).

If you rename or move the project folder this will change the project path.  Then, pipenv will no longer be able to find your virtualenv and it will make a new virtualenv. This leaves you with the old virtualenv still lying around on you system.  Luckily the fix is simple.
- Run 'pipenv --rm' *before* renaming or moving your project directory
- Then, after renaming or moving the directory run 'pipenv install' to recreate the virtualenv
