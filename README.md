------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Pipenv** is a tool that aims to bring the best of all packaging worlds
(bundler, composer, npm, cargo, yarn, etc.) to the Python world.
*Windows is a first--class citizen, in our world.*

It automatically creates and manages a virtualenv for your projects, as
well as adds/removes packages from your `Pipfile` as you
install/uninstall packages. It also generates the ever--important
`Pipfile.lock`, which is used to produce deterministic builds.

The problems that Pipenv seeks to solve are multi-faceted:

-   You no longer need to use `pip` and `virtualenv` separately. They
    work together.
-   Managing a `requirements.txt` file [can be
    problematic](https://www.kennethreitz.org/essays/a-better-pip-workflow),
    so Pipenv uses the upcoming `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` instead,
    which is superior for basic use cases.
-   Hashes are used everywhere, always. Security. Automatically expose
    security vulnerabilities.
-   Give you insight into your dependency graph (e.g. `$ pipenv graph`).
-   Streamline development workflow by loading `.env` files.

Installation
------------

If you\'re on MacOS, you can install Pipenv easily with Homebrew:

    $ brew install pipenv

Or, if you\'re using Fedora 28:

    $ sudo dnf install pipenv

Otherwise, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.pipenv.org/install/) for instructions.

‚ò§ User Testimonials
-------------------

**Jannis Leidel**, former pip maintainer---

:   *Pipenv is the porcelain I always wanted to build for pip. It fits
    my brain and mostly replaces virtualenvwrapper and manual pip calls
    for me. Use it.*

**David Gang**---

:   *This package manager is really awesome. For the first time I know
    exactly what my dependencies are which I installed and what the
    transitive dependencies are. Combined with the fact that installs
    are deterministic, makes this package manager first class, like
    cargo*.

**Justin Myles Holmes**---

:   *Pipenv is finally an abstraction meant to engage the mind instead
    of merely the filesystem.*

‚ò§ Features
----------

-   Enables truly *deterministic builds*, while easily specifying *only
    what you want*.
-   Generates and checks file hashes for locked dependencies.
-   Automatically install required Pythons, if `pyenv` is available.
-   Automatically finds your project home, recursively, by looking for a
    `Pipfile`.
-   Automatically generates a `Pipfile`, if one doesn\'t exist.
-   Automatically creates a virtualenv in a standard location.
-   Automatically adds/removes packages to a `Pipfile` when they are
    un/installed.
-   Automatically loads `.env` files, if they exist.

The main commands are `install`, `uninstall`, and `lock`, which
generates a `Pipfile.lock`. These are intended to replace
`$ pip install` usage, as well as manual virtualenv management (to
activate a virtualenv, run `$ pipenv shell`).

### Basic Concepts

-   A virtualenv will automatically be created, when one doesn\'t exist.
-   When no parameters are passed to `install`, all packages
    `[packages]` specified will be installed.
-   To initialize a Python 3 virtual environment, run
    `$ pipenv --three`.
-   To initialize a Python 2 virtual environment, run `$ pipenv --two`.
-   Otherwise, whatever virtualenv defaults to will be the default.

### Other Commands

-   `shell` will spawn a shell with the virtualenv activated.
-   `run` will run a given command from the virtualenv, with any
    arguments forwarded (e.g. `$ pipenv run python`).
-   `check` asserts that PEP 508 requirements are being met by the
    current environment.
-   `graph` will print a pretty graph of all your installed
    dependencies.

### Shell Completion

For example, with fish, put this in your
`~/.config/fish/completions/pipenv.fish`:

    eval (pipenv --completion)

Alternatively, with bash, put this in your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`:

    eval "$(pipenv --completion)"

Magic shell completions are now enabled! There is also a [fish
plugin](https://github.com/fisherman/pipenv), which will automatically
activate your subshells for you!

Fish is the best shell. You should use it.

Locate the project:

    $ pipenv --where
    /Users/kennethreitz/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/repos/kr/pipenv/test

Locate the virtualenv:

    $ pipenv --venv
    /Users/kennethreitz/.local/share/virtualenvs/test-Skyy4vre

Locate the Python interpreter:

    $ pipenv --py
    /Users/kennethreitz/.local/share/virtualenvs/test-Skyy4vre/bin/python

Install packages:

    $ pipenv install
    Creating a virtualenv for this project...
    ...
    No package provided, installing all dependencies.
    Virtualenv location: /Users/kennethreitz/.local/share/virtualenvs/test-EJkjoYts
    Installing dependencies from Pipfile.lock...
    ...

    To activate this project's virtualenv, run the following:
    $ pipenv shell

Installing from git:

You can install packages with pipenv from git and other version control systems using URLs formatted according to the following rule:

    <vcs_type>+<scheme>://<location>/<user_or_organization>/<repository>@<branch_or_tag>#<package_name>

The only optional section is the `@<branch_or_tag>` section.  When using git over SSH, you may use the shorthand vcs and scheme alias `git+git@<location>:<user_or_organization>/<repository>@<branch_or_tag>#<package_name>`. Note that this is translated to `git+ssh://git@<location>` when parsed.

Valid values for `<vcs_type>` include `git`, `bzr`, `svn`, and `hg`.  Valid values for `<scheme>` include `http,`, `https`, `ssh`, and `file`.  In specific cases you also have access to other schemes: `svn` may be combined with `svn` as a scheme, and `bzr` can be combined with `sftp` and `lp`.

Note that it is **strongly recommended** that you install any version-controlled dependencies in editable mode, using `pipenv install -e`, in order to ensure that dependency resolution can be performed with an up to date copy of the repository each time it is performed, and that it includes all known dependencies.

Below is an example usage which installs the git repository located at `https://github.com/requests/requests.git` from tag `v2.19.1` as package name `requests`:

    $ pipenv install -e git+https://github.com/requests/requests.git@v2.19#egg=requests
    Creating a Pipfile for this project...
    Installing -e git+https://github.com/requests/requests.git@v2.19.1#egg=requests...
    [...snipped...]
    Adding -e git+https://github.com/requests/requests.git@v2.19.1#egg=requests to Pipfile's [packages]...
    [...]
