Fix dependency resolution edge cases and versioning constraints handling:
* Allow JSON format options for ``--reverse`` dependency graph output matching pipdeptree
* Improve installation and upgrade routines to better handle dependencies
* Add ability to specify json output as pipdeptree does
* Add more consistent handling of VCS dependencies and references
* Fix synchronization of development and default dependencies during updates
* Ensure proper propagation of version constraints during updates
* Fix handling of ``~=`` and other version specifiers during updates

Key Changes:
* Improved reverse dependency analysis to catch conflicts earlier in resolution
* Better handling of VCS package lock data, preserving refs and subdirectories
* Fixed issue where VCS references could be lost in lock file when installed via commit hash
* Better handling of pipfile categories during installation and updates
* Corrected logic for development dependency resolution and constraint propagation
* Improved validation and preservation of version specifiers during updates

This improves stability when working with complex dependency trees and version constraints.
