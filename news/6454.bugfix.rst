Fix ``pipenv update`` incorrectly marking all packages as modified when Pipfile contains version ranges (e.g., ``>=2.25.1``) instead of exact versions. The comparison now properly checks if the locked version satisfies the Pipfile specifier, rather than doing a string comparison. This significantly improves performance of ``pipenv update`` when no packages have actually been modified.
