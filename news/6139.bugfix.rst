``pipenv`` converts off ``pkg_resources`` API usages.  This necessitated also vendoring in:
* latest ``pipdeptree==2.18.1`` which also converted off ``pkg_resources``
* ``importlib-metadata==6.5.1`` to continue supporting python 3.8 and 3.9
* ``packaging==24.0`` since the packaging we were utilizing in pip's _vendor was insufficient for this conversion.
