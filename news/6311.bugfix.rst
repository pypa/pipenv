Significantly improved performance through various optimizations:

* Added caching of parsed Pipfile content with a file lock and proper invalidation
* Optimized dependency resolution by reducing unnecessary subprocess calls
* Improved handling of reverse dependencies in the update process
* Added file locking mechanism to prevent concurrent Pipfile modifications
* Reduced redundant file operations and system calls
* Added developer utilities for profiling performance bottlenecks

Fixes bug with passing markers in CLI install command not getting propogated to Pipfile
