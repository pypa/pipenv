# Improved virtualenv scripts path resolution

## Summary

This PR refactors the logic for determining virtual environment script paths
by leveraging ``sysconfig``'s built-in mechanisms. By removing
platform-dependent logic, ``pipenv`` now offers enhanced compatibility with
POSIX-like environments, including Cygwin and MinGW. The fix also mitigates
execution inconsistencies in non-native Windows environments, improving
portability across platforms.

## Motivation

The original logic for determining the scripts path was unable to handle the
deviations of MSYS2 MinGW CPython identifying as ``nt`` platform, yet using a
POSIX ``{base}/bin`` path, instead of ``{base}/Scripts``.

## Changes

Removed custom logic for determining virtualenv scripts path in favor of
retrieving the basename of the path string returned by
``sysconfig.get_path('scripts')```.
