Fix editable package name being incorrectly parsed from test files in subdirectories.
Previously, when installing an editable local package, pipenv would recursively search
all subdirectories for ``setup.py`` files. This could cause a test file with a
``setup(name='foo')`` call to be incorrectly used as the package name. Now, ``setup.py``,
``setup.cfg``, and ``pyproject.toml`` are only checked in the root directory. Metadata
files (``PKG-INFO``, ``METADATA``) are still searched in ``.egg-info`` and ``.dist-info``
directories.

Fixes #6409
