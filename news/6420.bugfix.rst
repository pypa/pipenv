Fix ``pipenv update --dev`` (and ``pipenv update --categories develop``) updating
transitive dependencies in the ``develop`` section independently from the ``default``
section. Now, any packages that appear in both ``default`` and ``develop`` will use
the version from ``default``, ensuring consistent dependency versions between
production and development environments.

Fixes #6420
