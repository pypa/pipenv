Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixes regression from ``2022.10.9`` where ``Pipfile`` with ``pipenv`` section began generating new hash,
  and also fix regression where lock phase did not update the hash value.  `#5394 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/5394>`_


2022.10.9 (2022-10-09)
======================
Pipenv 2022.10.9 (2022-10-09)
=============================


Behavior Changes
----------------

- New pipfiles show python_full_version under [requires] if specified. Previously creating a new pipenv project would only specify in the Pipfile the major and minor version, i.e. "python_version = 3.7". Now if you create a new project with a fully named python version it will record both in the Pipfile. So: "python_version = 3.7" and "python_full_version = 3.7.2"  `#5345 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/5345>`_

Relates to dev process changes
------------------------------

- Silence majority of pytest.mark warnings by registering custom marks. Can view a list of custom marks by running ``pipenv run pytest --markers``

- Prefer to use the lockfile sources if available during the install phase.  `#5380 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/5380>`_

Vendored Libraries
------------------

- Drop vendored six - we no longer depend on this library, as we migrated from pipfile to plette.  `#5187 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/5187>`_


2022.9.24 (2022-09-24)

2022.9.20 (2022-09-20)
======================
Pipenv 2022.9.20 (2022-09-20)
=============================


Behavior Changes
----------------

- Remove usage of pipfile module in favour of Plette.
  pipfile is not actively maintained anymore. Plette is actively maintained,
  and has stricter checking of the Pipefile and Pipefile.lock. As a result,
  Pipefile with unnamed package indecies will fail to lock. If a Pipefile
  was hand crafeted, and the source is anonymous an error will be thrown.
  The solution is simple, add a name to your index, e.g, replace::

     [[source]]
     url = "https://pypi.acme.com/simple"
     verify_ssl = true

  With::

     [[source]]
     url = "https://pypi.acme.com/simple"
     verify_ssl = true
     name = acmes_private_index  `#5339 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/5339>`_

Bug Fixes
---------

- Modernize ``pipenv`` path patch with ``importlib.util`` to eliminate import of ``pkg_resources``  `#5349 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/5349>`_

============================


Features & Improvements
-----------------------

- It is now possible to supply additional arguments to ``pip`` install by supplying ``--extra-pip-args="<arg1> <arg2>"``
  See the updated documentation ``Supplying additional arguments to pip`` for more details.  `#5283 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/5283>`_

Bug Fixes

- Add error handling for when the installed package setup.py does not contain valid markers.  `#5329 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/5329>`_
- Load the dot env earlier so that ``PIPENV_CUSTOM_VENV_NAME`` is more useful across projects.  `#5334 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/5334>`_

Vendored Libraries
------------------

- Bump version of shellingham to support nushell.  `#5336 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/5336>`_
- Bump plette to version v0.3.0  `#5337 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/5337>`_
- Bump version of pipdeptree  `#5343 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/5343>`_

Removals and Deprecations
-------------------------

- ``pipenv`` now uses a  ``NamedTemporaryFile`` for rsolver constraints and drops internal env var ``PIPENV_PACKAGES``.  `#4925 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/4925>`_

Removals and Deprecations
-------------------------

- Remove no longer used method ``which_pip``.  `#5314 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/5314>`_
- Drop progress bar file due to recent performance optimization to combine ``batch_install`` requirements in at most two invocations of ``pip install``.
  To see progress of install pass ``--verbose`` flag and ``pip`` progress will be output in realtime.  `#5315 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/5315>`_


2022.8.30 (2022-08-30)
======================

Vendored Libraries
------------------

- Depend on ``requests`` and ``certifi`` from vendored ``pip`` and remove them as explicit vendor dependencies.  `#5000 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/5000>`_
- Vendor in the latest version of ``requirementslib==1.6.5`` which includes bug fixes for beta python versions, projects with an at sign (@) in the path, and a ``setuptools`` deprecation warning.  `#5132 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/5132>`_

Relates to dev process changes
------------------------------

2022.5.3.dev0 (2022-06-07)
==========================


Bug Fixes
---------

- Adjust pipenv to work with the newly added ``venv`` install scheme in Python.
  First check if ``venv`` is among the available install schemes, and use it if it is. Otherwise fall back to the ``nt`` or ``posix_prefix`` install schemes as before. This should produce no change for environments where the install schemes were not redefined.  `#5096 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/5096>`_


2022.5.2 (2022-05-02)
=====================


Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixes issue of ``pipenv lock -r`` command printing to stdout instead of stderr.  `#5091 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/5091>`_

- Fixes issue of requirements command where git requirements cause the command to fail, solved by using existing convert_deps_to_pip function.  `#5076 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/5076>`_

Vendored Libraries
------------------

- Vendor in ``requirementslib==1.6.4`` to Fix ``SetuptoolsDeprecationWarning`` ``setuptools.config.read_configuration`` became deprecated.  `#5081 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/5081>`_

Removals and Deprecations
-------------------------

- Remove more usage of misc functions of vistir. Many of this function are availabel in the STL or in another dependency of pipenv.  `#5078 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/5078>`_


2022.4.21 (2022-04-21)
======================


Removals and Deprecations
-------------------------

- Updated setup.py to remove support for python 3.6 from built ``pipenv`` packages' Metadata.  `#5065 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/5065>`_


2022.4.20 (2022-04-20)
======================


Features & Improvements
-----------------------

- Added new Pipenv option ``install_search_all_sources`` that allows installation of packages from an
  existing ``Pipfile.lock`` to search all defined indexes for the constrained package version and hash signatures.  `#5041 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/5041>`_

Bug Fixes
---------

- allow the user to disable the ``no_input`` flag, so the use of e.g Google Artifact Registry is possible.  `#4706 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/4706>`_
- Fixes case where packages could fail to install and the exit code was successful.  `#5031 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/5031>`_

Vendored Libraries
------------------

- Updated vendor version of ``pip`` from ``21.2.2`` to ``22.0.4`` which fixes a number of bugs including
  several reports of pipenv locking for an infinite amount of time when using certain package constraints.
  This also drops support for python 3.6 as it is EOL and support was removed in pip 22.x  `#4995 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/4995>`_

Removals and Deprecations
-------------------------

- Removed the vendor dependency ``more-itertools`` as it was originally added for ``zipp``, which since stopped using it.  `#5044 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/5044>`_
- Removed all usages of ``pipenv.vendor.vistir.compat.fs_str``, since this function was used for PY2-PY3 compatability and is no longer needed.  `#5062 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/5062>`_

Relates to dev process changes
------------------------------

- Added pytest-cov and basic configuration to the project for generating html testing coverage reports.
- Make all CI jobs run only after the lint stage. Also added a makefile target for vendoring the packages.


2022.4.8 (2022-04-08)
=====================


Features & Improvements
-----------------------

- Implements a ``pipenv requirements`` command which generates a requirements.txt compatible output without locking.  `#4959 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/4959>`_
- Internal to pipenv, the utils.py was split into a utils module with unused code removed.  `#4992 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/4992>`_

Bug Fixes
---------

- Pipenv will now ignore ``.venv`` in the project when ``PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT`` variable is False.
  Unset variable maintains the existing behavior of preferring to use the project's ``.venv`` should it exist.  `#2763 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2763>`_
- Fix an edge case of hash collection in index restricted packages whereby the hashes for some packages would
  be missing from the ``Pipfile.lock`` following package index restrictions added in ``pipenv==2022.3.23``.  `#5023 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/5023>`_

Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Pipenv CLI documentation generation has been fixed.  It had broke when ``click`` was vendored into the project in
  ``2021.11.9`` because by default ``sphinx-click`` could no longer determine the CLI inherited from click.  `#4778 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/4778>`_
- Improve documentation around extra indexes and index restricted packages.  `#5022 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/5022>`_

Removals and Deprecations
-------------------------

- Removes the optional ``install`` argument ``--extra-index-url`` as it was not compatible with index restricted packages.
  Using the ``--index`` argument is the correct way to specify a package should be pulled from the non-default index.  `#5022 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/5022>`_

Relates to dev process changes
------------------------------

- Added code linting using pre-commit-hooks, black, flake8, isort, pygrep-hooks, news-fragments and check-manifest.
  Very similar to pip's configuration; adds a towncrier new's type ``process`` for change to Development processes.


2022.3.28 (2022-03-27)
======================


Bug Fixes
---------

- Environment variables were not being loaded when the ``--quiet`` flag was set  `#5010 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/5010>`_
- It would appear that ``requirementslib`` was not fully specifying the subdirectory to ``build_pep517`` and
  and when a new version of ``setuptools`` was released, the test ``test_lock_nested_vcs_direct_url``
  broke indicating the Pipfile.lock no longer contained the extra dependencies that should have been resolved.
  This regression affected ``pipenv>=2021.11.9`` but has been fixed by a patch to ``requirementslib``.  `#5019 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/5019>`_

Vendored Libraries
------------------

- Vendor in pip==21.2.4 (from 21.2.2) in order to bring in requested bug fix for python3.6.  Note: support for 3.6 will be dropped in a subsequent release.  `#5008 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/5008>`_

  with the ``--quiet`` flag or the ``PIPENV_QUIET`` environment variable.  `#4027 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/4027>`_

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixes issue with new index safety restriction, whereby an unnamed extra sources index
  caused and error to be thrown during install.  `#5002 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/5002>`_
- The text ``Loading .env environment variables...`` has been switched back to stderr as to not
  break requirements.txt generation.  Also it only prints now when a ``.env`` file is actually present.  `#5003 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/5003>`_


2022.3.23 (2022-03-22)
======================


Features & Improvements
-----------------------

- Environment variables from dot env files are now properly expanded when included in scripts.  `#4975 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/4975>`_

Vendored Libraries
------------------

- Updated vendor version of ``pythonfinder`` from ``1.2.9`` to ``1.2.10`` which fixes a bug with WSL
  (Windows Subsystem for Linux) when a path can not be read and Permission Denied error is encountered.  `#4976 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/4976>`_

Removals and Deprecations
-------------------------

2020.5.28 (2020-05-28)
======================

Features & Improvements
-----------------------

- ``pipenv install`` and ``pipenv sync`` will no longer attempt to install satisfied dependencies during installation.  `#3057 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3057>`_,
  `#3506 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3506>`_
- Added support for resolution of direct-url dependencies in ``setup.py`` files to respect ``PEP-508`` style URL dependencies.  `#3148 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3148>`_
- Added full support for resolution of all dependency types including direct URLs, zip archives, tarballs, etc.

  - Improved error handling and formatting.

  - Introduced improved cross platform stream wrappers for better ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` consistency.  `#3298 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3298>`_
- For consistency with other commands and the ``--dev`` option
  description, ``pipenv lock --requirements --dev`` now emits
  both default and development dependencies.
  The new ``--dev-only`` option requests the previous
  behaviour (e.g. to generate a ``dev-requirements.txt`` file).  `#3316 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3316>`_
- Pipenv will now successfully recursively lock VCS sub-dependencies.  `#3328 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3328>`_
- Added support for ``--verbose`` output to ``pipenv run``.  `#3348 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3348>`_
- Pipenv will now discover and resolve the intrinsic dependencies of **all** VCS dependencies, whether they are editable or not, to prevent resolution conflicts.  `#3368 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3368>`_
- Added a new environment variable, ``PIPENV_RESOLVE_VCS``, to toggle dependency resolution off for non-editable VCS, file, and URL based dependencies.  `#3577 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3577>`_
- Added the ability for Windows users to enable emojis by setting ``PIPENV_HIDE_EMOJIS=0``.  `#3595 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3595>`_
- Allow overriding PIPENV_INSTALL_TIMEOUT environment variable (in seconds).  `#3652 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3652>`_
- Allow overriding PIP_EXISTS_ACTION evironment variable (value is passed to pip install).
  Possible values here: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip/#exists-action-option
  Useful when you need to ``PIP_EXISTS_ACTION=i`` (ignore existing packages) - great for CI environments, where you need really fast setup.  `#3738 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3738>`_
- Pipenv will no longer forcibly override ``PIP_NO_DEPS`` on all vcs and file dependencies as resolution happens on these in a pre-lock step.  `#3763 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3763>`_
- Improved verbose logging output during ``pipenv lock`` will now stream output to the console while maintaining a spinner.  `#3810 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3810>`_
- Added support for automatic python installs via ``asdf`` and associated ``PIPENV_DONT_USE_ASDF`` environment variable.  `#4018 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/4018>`_
- Pyenv/asdf can now be used whether or not they are available on PATH. Setting PYENV_ROOT/ASDF_DIR in a Pipenv's .env allows Pipenv to install an interpreter without any shell customizations, so long as pyenv/asdf is installed.  `#4245 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/4245>`_
- Added ``--key`` command line parameter for including personal PyUp.io API tokens when running ``pipenv check``.  `#4257 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/4257>`_

Behavior Changes
----------------

- Make conservative checks of known exceptions when subprocess returns output, so user won't see the whole traceback - just the error.  `#2553 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2553>`_
- Do not touch Pipfile early and rely on it so that one can do ``pipenv sync`` without a Pipfile.  `#3386 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3386>`_
- Re-enable ``--help`` option for ``pipenv run`` command.  `#3844 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3844>`_
- Make sure ``pipenv lock -r --pypi-mirror {MIRROR_URL}`` will respect the pypi-mirror in requirements output.  `#4199 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/4199>`_

======================

Features & Improvements
-----------------------

- Pipenv-created virtualenvs will now be associated with a ``.project`` folder
  (features can be implemented on top of this later or users may choose to use
  ``pipenv-pipes`` to take full advantage of this.)  `#1861
  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/1861>`_

  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2384>`_

- ``pipenv run`` will now avoid spawning additional ``COMSPEC`` instances to
  run commands in when possible.  `#2385
  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2385>`_

  .. warning:: This could cause an issue if you have an out of date ``Pipfile``
  which lower-cases the comparison value (e.g. ``cpython`` instead of
  ``CPython``).  `#2123 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2123>`_

- Pipenv will now only search for ``requirements.txt`` files when creating new

  a virtualenv.  `#2181 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2181>`_

- Removed vendored ``cacert.pem`` which could cause issues for some users with
  custom certificate settings.  `#2193
  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2193>`_

- Fixed a regression which led to direct invocations of ``virtualenv``, rather
  than calling it by module.  `#2198
  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2198>`_

- Locking will now pin the correct VCS ref during ``pipenv update`` runs.
  Running ``pipenv update`` with a new vcs ref specified in the ``Pipfile``
  will now properly obtain, resolve, and install the specified dependency at
  the specified ref.  `#2209 <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2209>`_

  resolution failures in certain conditions. Running ``pipenv install`` with no
  arguments in a project with only a ``Pipfile`` will now correctly lock first
  for dependency resolution before installing.  `#2384
  <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2384>`_

- Patched ``python-dotenv`` to ensure that environment variables always get
  encoded to the filesystem encoding.  `#2386
