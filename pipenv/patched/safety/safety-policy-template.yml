# Safety Security and License Configuration file
# We recommend checking this file into your source control in the root of your Python project
# If this file is named .safety-policy.yml and is in the same directory where you run `safety check` it will be used by default.
# Otherwise, you can use the flag `safety check --policy-file <path-to-this-file>` to specify a custom location and name for the file.
# To validate and review your policy file, run the validate command: `safety validate policy_file --path <path-to-this-file>`
