"""Typed ``Requirement`` model for the pure-Python resolver backend
(Initiative G Phase 3, T1).

Represents one constraint in the resolution graph as a frozen dataclass
— replaces pip's ``InstallRequirement`` for the in-tree
``resolvelib.Provider`` path.

A :class:`Requirement` is what the provider hands to ``resolvelib`` as
a graph node alongside :class:`pipenv.resolver.candidate.Candidate`
(the matching artifact).  ``resolvelib`` groups requirements by
``(name, extras)`` via :meth:`PurePythonProvider.identify` (T3), so the
dataclass exposes ``name`` PEP-503-canonical (lowercase, ``-``
separators) and ``extras`` as a :class:`frozenset` — both hashable
and stable across construction sites.

The class is intentionally minimal: it carries the *constraints*
declared by either the Pipfile or a transitive's ``Requires-Dist`` line,
nothing else.  Candidate-side concerns (URL, hashes, wheel tags) live
on :class:`Candidate`; satisfaction checks (``is_satisfied_by``) and
candidate ordering (``find_matches``) live on :class:`PurePythonProvider`
(T4–T6).

Critical constraint (enforced by Phase 1's pre-commit grep gate):
**this module must not import from patched-pip's internal package.**
The vendored ``pipenv.vendor.packaging`` is permitted and supplies
:class:`SpecifierSet` and :class:`Marker`.

See ``docs/dev/initiative-g-phase3-design.md`` §5.1 for the design
brief and ``initiative-g-phase3-plan.md`` T1 for the validation
matrix.

class Requirement:
    """One constraint in the resolution graph.

    Mirrors design §5.1.  All fields are immutable (``frozen=True``)
    and laid out compactly (``slots=True``) — phase-3 resolves carry
    hundreds to low-thousands of these in memory, so the footprint
    matters.

    Field semantics
    ---------------
    name:
        PEP 503 canonical (lowercase, ``-`` separators).  Use
        :meth:`from_pipfile_entry` to construct from a Pipfile shape —
        it runs ``canonicalize_name`` for you.  Direct construction
        assumes the caller already canonicalised.
    specifier:
        :class:`SpecifierSet` from ``pipenv.vendor.packaging``.  An
        empty :class:`SpecifierSet` (``SpecifierSet("")``) means "any
        version is acceptable" — this is what a Pipfile ``"*"`` entry
        flattens to.
    extras:
        :class:`frozenset` of extra names this requirement requests.
        ``resolvelib``'s identifier is ``(name, extras)`` — two
        requests for the same package with different extras are
        distinct graph nodes.  Frozenset (not list/tuple) so the
        dataclass-derived ``__hash__`` is order-independent.
    marker:
        Optional :class:`Marker` from ``pipenv.vendor.packaging``.
        ``None`` means "always applies".  Evaluation against the
        target environment happens in :meth:`PurePythonProvider.is_satisfied_by`
        (T6) and dependency-filtering inside
        :meth:`PurePythonProvider.get_dependencies` (T7).
    source:
        Where this requirement came from — a Pipfile entry, a
        transitive ``Requires-Dist``, or a constraint file.  Drives
        :meth:`PurePythonProvider.get_preference`'s tie-breaking
        (T5): Pipfile-direct beats transitive.
    parent:
        Name of the candidate that produced this transitive
        requirement (``None`` for Pipfile / constraint sources).  Used
        for diagnostics — when a conflict arises ``resolvelib`` reports
        the offending requirement and the parent chain is what the
        user needs to understand "why is this in my graph?".

    Hashability
    -----------
    Both :class:`SpecifierSet` and :class:`Marker` are hashable in
    ``pipenv.vendor.packaging`` (specifiers.py:842, markers.py:329) —
    the dataclass-derived ``__hash__`` from ``frozen=True`` therefore
    works out of the box, no custom override needed.  Phase-3
    callers rely on ``frozenset[Requirement]`` membership, so this
    is verified explicitly by the T1 / T11 test suite.

        Handles the three canonical Pipfile shapes:

        * ``"*"`` (any version) → empty :class:`SpecifierSet`.
        * ``">=4.0,<6"`` (version specifier string) → parsed
          :class:`SpecifierSet`.
        * ``{"version": ">=4.0", "extras": ["argon2"],
          "markers": "python_version >= '3.10'"}`` → all three fields
          parsed.  ``"version": "*"`` also flattens to an empty
          :class:`SpecifierSet`.

        ``name`` is canonicalised via
        :func:`pipenv.vendor.packaging.utils.canonicalize_name` —
        ``"Django_Rest"`` → ``"django-rest"`` — so callers don't have
        to pre-normalise.

        Other dict keys (``editable``, ``path``, ``git``, ``index``,
        etc.) are *not* interpreted here: they belong on
        :class:`Candidate` / a separate VCS-source path, not on the
        resolution-graph constraint node.  T1's job is the constraint
        triple; richer source kinds land in later phases.
