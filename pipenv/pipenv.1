\fBPipenv\fP is a tool that aims to bring the best of all packaging worlds (bundler, composer, npm, cargo, yarn, etc.) to the Python world. \fIWindows is a first\-class citizen, in our world.\fP
.sp
It automatically creates and manages a virtualenv for your projects, as well as adds/removes packages from your \fBPipfile\fP as you install/uninstall packages. It also generates the ever\-important \fBPipfile.lock\fP, which is used to produce deterministic builds.
.sp
Pipenv is primarily meant to provide users and developers of applications with an easy method to setup a working environment. For the distinction between libraries and applications and the usage of \fBsetup.py\fP vs \fBPipfile\fP to define dependencies, see pipfile\-vs\-setuppy\&.

The problems that Pipenv seeks to solve are multi\-faceted:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
You no longer need to use \fBpip\fP and \fBvirtualenv\fP separately. They work together.
.IP \(bu 2
Managing a \fBrequirements.txt\fP file \fI\%can be problematic\fP, so Pipenv uses \fBPipfile\fP and \fBPipfile.lock\fP to separate abstract dependency declarations from the last tested combination.
.IP \(bu 2
Hashes are used everywhere, always. Security. Automatically expose security vulnerabilities.
.IP \(bu 2
Strongly encourage the use of the latest versions of dependencies to minimize security risks \fI\%arising from outdated components\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
Give you insight into your dependency graph (e.g. \fB$ pipenv graph\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Streamline development workflow by loading \fB\&.env\fP files.

\fI\%Try in browser\fP.SH INSTALL PIPENV TODAY!
.sp
If you already have Python and pip, you can easily install Pipenv into your home directory:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ pip install \-\-user pipenv
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT

$ sudo dnf install pipenv
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
It\(aqs possible to install Pipenv with Homebrew on MacOS, or with Linuxbrew on Linux systems. However, \fBthis is now discouraged\fP, because updates to the brewed Python distribution will break Pipenv, and perhaps all virtual environments managed by it. You\(aqll then need to re\-install Pipenv at least. If you want to give it a try despite this warning, use:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.SS Pipenv & Virtual Environments
[image]
.sp
This tutorial walks you through installing and using Python packages.
.sp
It will show you how to install and use the necessary tools and make strong
recommendations on best practices. Keep in mind that Python is used for a great
many different purposes, and precisely how you want to manage your dependencies
may change based on how you decide to publish your software. The guidance
presented here is most directly applicable to the development and deployment of
network services (including web applications), but is also very well suited to
managing development and testing environments for any kind of project.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This guide is written for Python 3, however, these instructions
should work fine on Python 2.7—if you are still using it, for some reason.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS ☤ Make sure you\(aqve got Python & pip
.sp
Before you go any further, make sure you have Python and that it\(aqs available
from your command line. You can check this by simply running:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ python \-\-version
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You should get some output like \fB3.6.2\fP\&. If you do not have Python, please
install the latest 3.x version from \fI\%python.org\fP or refer to the
\fI\%Installing Python\fP section of \fIThe Hitchhiker\(aqs Guide to Python\fP\&.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0

If you\(aqre newcomer and you get an error like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C

  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name \(aqpython\(aq is not defined
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
It\(aqs because this command is intended to be run in a \fIshell\fP (also called
a \fIterminal\fP or \fIconsole\fP). See the Python for Beginners
\fI\%getting started tutorial\fP for an introduction to using your operating
system\(aqs shell and interacting with Python.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Additionally, you\(aqll need to make sure you have pip available. You can
check this by running:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ pip \-\-version
pip 9.0.1
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you installed Python from source, with an installer from \fI\%python.org\fP, via \fI\%Homebrew\fP or via \fI\%Linuxbrew\fP you should already have pip. If you\(aqre on Linux and installed
using your OS package manager, you may have to \fI\%install pip\fP separately.
.sp
If you plan to install Pipenv using Homebrew or Linuxbrew you can skip this step. The
Homebrew/Linuxbrew installer takes care of pip for you.
.SS ☤ Installing Pipenv
.sp
Pipenv is a dependency manager for Python projects. If you\(aqre familiar
with Node.js\(aqs \fI\%npm\fP or Ruby\(aqs \fI\%bundler\fP, it is similar in spirit to those
tools. While pip can install Python packages, Pipenv is recommended as
it\(aqs a higher\-level tool that simplifies dependency management for common use
cases.
.SS ☤ Isolated Installation of Pipenv with Pipx
.sp
\fI\%Pipx\fP is a tool to help you install and run end\-user applications written in Python. It installs applications
into an isolated and clean environment on their own. To install pipx, just run:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ pip install \-\-user pipx
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Once you have \fBpipx\fP ready on your system, continue to install Pipenv:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ pipx install pipenv
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS ☤ Pragmatic Installation of Pipenv
.sp
If you have a working installation of pip, and maintain certain "tool\-chain" type Python modules as global utilities in your user environment, pip \fI\%user installs\fP allow for installation into your home directory. Note that due to interaction between dependencies, you should limit tools installed in this way to basic building blocks for a Python workflow like virtualenv, pipenv, tox, and similar software.
.sp
To install:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ pip install \-\-user pipenv
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This does a \fI\%user installation\fP to prevent breaking any system\-wide
packages. If \fBpipenv\fP isn\(aqt available in your shell after installation,
you\(aqll need to add the \fI\%user base\fP\(aqs binary directory to your \fBPATH\fP\&.
.sp
On Linux and macOS you can find the user base binary directory by running
\fBpython \-m site \-\-user\-base\fP and adding \fBbin\fP to the end. For example,
this will typically print \fB~/.local\fP (with \fB~\fP expanded to the
absolute path to your home directory) so you\(aqll need to add
\fB~/.local/bin\fP to your \fBPATH\fP\&. You can set your \fBPATH\fP permanently by
\fI\%modifying ~/.profile\fP\&.
.sp
On Windows you can find the user base binary directory by running
\fBpython \-m site \-\-user\-site\fP and replacing \fBsite\-packages\fP with
\fBScripts\fP\&. For example, this could return
\fBC:\eUsers\eUsername\eAppData\eRoaming\ePython36\esite\-packages\fP so you would
need to set your \fBPATH\fP to include
\fBC:\eUsers\eUsername\eAppData\eRoaming\ePython36\eScripts\fP\&. You can set your
user \fBPATH\fP permanently in the \fI\%Control Panel\fP\&. You may need to log
out for the \fBPATH\fP changes to take effect.
.sp
For more information, see the \fI\%user installs documentation\fP\&.

.SS ☤ Homebrew Installation of Pipenv(Discouraged)
.sp
\fI\%Homebrew\fP is a popular open\-source package management system for macOS. For Linux users, \fI\%Linuxbrew\fP  is a Linux port of that.
.sp
Installing pipenv via Homebrew or Linuxbrew will keep pipenv and all of its dependencies in
an isolated virtual environment so it doesn\(aqt interfere with the rest of your
Python installation.
.sp
Once you have installed Homebrew or Linuxbrew simply run:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ brew install pipenv
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Homebrew installation is discouraged because each time the Homebrew Python is upgraded, which Pipenv depends on,
users have to re\-install Pipenv, and perhaps all virtual environments managed by it.

.SS ☤ Installing packages for your project
.sp
Pipenv manages dependencies on a per\-project basis. To install packages,
change into your project\(aqs directory (or just an empty directory for this
tutorial) and run:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ cd myproject
$ pipenv install requests
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Pipenv will install the excellent \fI\%Requests\fP library and create a \fBPipfile\fP
for you in your project\(aqs directory. The \fBPipfile\fP is used to track which
dependencies your project needs in case you need to re\-install them, such as
when you share your project with others. You should get output similar to this
(although the exact paths shown will vary):

.SS ☤ Virtualenv mapping caveat
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Pipenv automatically maps projects to their specific virtualenvs.
.IP \(bu 2
The virtualenv is stored globally with the name of the project’s root directory plus the hash of the full path to the project\(aqs root (e.g., \fBmy_project\-a3de50\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
If you change your project\(aqs path, you break such a default mapping and pipenv will no longer be able to find and to use the project\(aqs virtualenv.
.IP \(bu 2
You might want to set \fBexport PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT=1\fP in your .bashrc/.zshrc (or any shell configuration file) for creating the virtualenv inside your project\(aqs directory, avoiding problems with subsequent path changes.

This document covers some of Pipenv\(aqs more basic features.
.SS ☤ Example Pipfile & Pipfile.lock
.sp
Pipfiles contain information for the dependencies of the project, and supersedes
the requirements.txt file used in most Python projects. You should add a Pipfile in the
Git repository letting users who clone the repository know the only thing required would be
installing Pipenv in the machine and typing \fBpipenv install\fP\&. Pipenv is a reference
implementation for using Pipfile.
.sp
Here is a simple example of a \fBPipfile\fP and the resulting \fBPipfile.lock\fP\&.

Generally, keep both \fBPipfile\fP and \fBPipfile.lock\fP in version control.
.IP \(bu 2
Do not keep \fBPipfile.lock\fP in version control if multiple versions of Python are being targeted.
.IP \(bu 2
Specify your target Python version in your \fIPipfile\fP\(aqs \fB[requires]\fP section. Ideally, you should only have one target Python version, as this is a deployment tool. \fBpython_version\fP should be in the format \fBX.Y\fP (or \fBX\fP) and \fBpython_full_version\fP should be in \fBX.Y.Z\fP format.

.SS ☤ Importing from requirements.txt
.sp
If you only have a \fBrequirements.txt\fP file available when running \fBpipenv install\fP,
pipenv will automatically import the contents of this file and create a \fBPipfile\fP for you.
.sp
You can also specify \fB$ pipenv install \-r path/to/requirements.txt\fP to import a requirements file.
.sp
If your requirements file has version numbers pinned, you\(aqll likely want to edit the new \fBPipfile\fP
to remove those, and let \fBpipenv\fP keep track of pinning.  If you want to keep the pinned versions
in your \fBPipfile.lock\fP for now, run \fBpipenv lock \-\-keep\-outdated\fP\&.  Make sure to
\fI\%upgrade\fP soon!
.SS ☤ Specifying Versions of a Package
.sp
You can specify versions of a package using the \fI\%Semantic Versioning scheme\fP
(i.e. \fBmajor.minor.micro\fP).
.sp
For example, to install requests you can use:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ pipenv install requests~=1.2
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Pipenv will install version \fB1.2\fP and any minor update, but not \fB2.0\fP\&.
.sp
This will update your \fBPipfile\fP to reflect this requirement, automatically.
.sp
In general, Pipenv uses the same specifier format as pip. However, note that according to \fI\%PEP 440\fP , you can\(aqt use versions containing a hyphen or a plus sign.
.sp
To make inclusive or exclusive version comparisons you can use:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ pipenv install "requests>=1.4"   # will install a version equal or larger than 1.4.0
$ pipenv install "requests<=2.13"  # will install a version equal or lower than 2.13.0
$ pipenv install "requests>2.19"   # will install 2.19.1 but not 2.19.0
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The use of double quotes around the package and version specification (i.e. \fB"requests>2.19"\fP) is highly recommended
to avoid issues with \fI\%Input and output redirection\fP
in Unix\-based operating systems.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The use of \fB~=\fP is preferred over the \fB==\fP identifier as the latter prevents pipenv from updating the packages:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ pipenv install "requests~=2.2"  # locks the major version of the package (this is equivalent to using >=2.2, ==2.*)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To avoid installing a specific version you can use the \fB!=\fP identifier.
.sp
For an in depth explanation of the valid identifiers and more complex use cases check \fI\%the relevant section of PEP\-440\fP\&.
.SS ☤ Specifying Versions of Python
.sp
To create a new virtualenv, using a specific version of Python you have installed (and
on your \fBPATH\fP), use the \fB\-\-python VERSION\fP flag, like so:
.sp
Use Python 3:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ pipenv \-\-python 3
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Use Python3.6:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ pipenv \-\-python 3.6
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Use Python 2.7.14:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ pipenv \-\-python 2.7.14
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
When given a Python version, like this, Pipenv will automatically scan your system for a Python that matches that given version.
.sp
If a \fBPipfile\fP hasn\(aqt been created yet, one will be created for you, that looks like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[[source]]

python_version = "3.6"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The inclusion of \fB[requires] python_version = "3.6"\fP specifies that your application requires this version
of Python, and will be used automatically when running \fBpipenv install\fP against this \fBPipfile\fP in the future
(e.g. on other machines). If this is not true, feel free to simply remove this section.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you don\(aqt specify a Python version on the command–line, either the \fB[requires]\fP \fBpython_full_version\fP or \fBpython_version\fP will be selected
automatically, falling back to whatever your system\(aqs default \fBpython\fP installation is, at time of execution.
.SS ☤ Editable Dependencies (e.g. \fB\-e .\fP )
.sp
You can tell Pipenv to install a path as editable — often this is useful for
the current working directory when working on packages:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ pipenv install \-\-dev \-e .

$ cat Pipfile
\&...
[dev\-packages]
"e1839a8" = {path = ".", editable = true}
\&...
.ft P

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
All sub\-dependencies will get added to the \fBPipfile.lock\fP as well. Sub\-dependencies are \fBnot\fP added to the
\fBPipfile.lock\fP if you leave the \fB\-e\fP option out.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS ☤ Environment Management with Pipenv
.sp
The three primary commands you\(aqll use in managing your pipenv environment are
\fB$ pipenv install\fP, \fB$ pipenv uninstall\fP, and \fB$ pipenv lock\fP\&.
.SS $ pipenv install
.sp
\fB$ pipenv install\fP is used for installing packages into the pipenv virtual environment
and updating your Pipfile.
.sp
Along with the basic install command, which takes the form:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C

.SS $ pipenv lock
.sp
\fB$ pipenv lock\fP is used to create a \fBPipfile.lock\fP, which declares \fBall\fP dependencies (and sub\-dependencies) of your project, their latest available versions, and the current hashes for the downloaded files. This ensures repeatable, and most importantly \fIdeterministic\fP, builds.
.SS ☤ About Shell Configuration
.sp
Shells are typically misconfigured for subshell use, so \fB$ pipenv shell \-\-fancy\fP may produce unexpected results. If this is the case, try \fB$ pipenv shell\fP, which uses "compatibility mode", and will attempt to spawn a subshell despite misconfiguration.
.sp
A proper shell configuration only sets environment variables like \fBPATH\fP during a login session, not during every subshell spawn (as they are typically configured to do). In fish, this looks like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
if status \-\-is\-login
    set \-gx PATH /usr/local/bin $PATH
end
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You should do this for your shell too, in your \fB~/.profile\fP or \fB~/.bashrc\fP or wherever appropriate.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The shell launched in interactive mode. This means that if your shell reads its configuration from a specific file for interactive mode (e.g. bash by default looks for a \fB~/.bashrc\fP configuration file for interactive mode), then you\(aqll need to modify (or create) this file.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you experience issues with \fB$ pipenv shell\fP, just check the \fBPIPENV_SHELL\fP environment variable, which \fB$ pipenv shell\fP will use if available. For detail, see configuration\-with\-environment\-variables\&.
.SS ☤ A Note about VCS Dependencies
.sp
You can install packages with pipenv from git and other version control systems using URLs formatted according to the following rule:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
<vcs_type>+<scheme>://<location>/<user_or_organization>/<repository>@<branch_or_tag>#egg=<package_name>
.ft P

.SS ☤ Pipfile.lock Security Features
.sp
\fBPipfile.lock\fP takes advantage of some great new security improvements in \fBpip\fP\&.
By default, the \fBPipfile.lock\fP will be generated with the sha256 hashes of each downloaded
package. This will allow \fBpip\fP to guarantee you\(aqre installing what you intend to when
on a compromised network, or downloading dependencies from an untrusted PyPI endpoint.
.sp
We highly recommend approaching deployments with promoting projects from a development
environment into production. You can use \fBpipenv lock\fP to compile your dependencies on
your development environment and deploy the compiled \fBPipfile.lock\fP to all of your
production environments for reproducible builds.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If you\(aqd like a \fBrequirements.txt\fP output of the lockfile, run \fB$ pipenv lock \-r\fP\&.
This will not include hashes, however. To get a \fBrequirements.txt\fP
you can also use \fB$ pipenv run pip freeze\fP\&.

.UNINDENT
.SS ☤ Specifying Package Indexes
.sp
If you\(aqd like a specific package to be installed with a specific package index, you can do the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[[source]]
url = "https://pypi.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true

.UNINDENT
.sp
Very fancy.
.SS ☤ Using a PyPI Mirror
.sp
If you would like to override the default PyPI index URLs with the URL for a PyPI mirror, you can use the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ pipenv install \-\-pypi\-mirror <mirror_url>

$ pipenv update \-\-pypi\-mirror <mirror_url>

$ pipenv sync \-\-pypi\-mirror <mirror_url>

$ pipenv lock \-\-pypi\-mirror <mirror_url>

$ pipenv uninstall \-\-pypi\-mirror <mirror_url>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Alternatively, you can set the \fBPIPENV_PYPI_MIRROR\fP environment variable.
.SS ☤ Injecting credentials into Pipfiles via environment variables
.sp
Pipenv will expand environment variables (if defined) in your Pipfile. Quite
useful if you need to authenticate to a private PyPI:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[[source]]
url = "https://$USERNAME:${PASSWORD}@mypypi.example.com/simple"
verify_ssl = true
name = "pypi"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Luckily \- pipenv will hash your Pipfile \fIbefore\fP expanding environment
variables (and, helpfully, will substitute the environment variables again when
you install from the lock file \- so no need to commit any secrets! Woo!)
.sp
If your credentials contain special characters, make sure they are URL\-encoded as specified in \fI\%rfc3986\fP\&.
.sp
Environment variables may be specified as \fB${MY_ENVAR}\fP or \fB$MY_ENVAR\fP\&.
.sp
On Windows, \fB%MY_ENVAR%\fP is supported in addition to \fB${MY_ENVAR}\fP or \fB$MY_ENVAR\fP\&.
.sp
Environment variables in the URL part of requirement specifiers can also be expanded, where the variable must be in the form of \fB${VAR_NAME}\fP\&. Neither \fB$VAR_NAME\fP nor \fB%VAR_NAME%\fP is acceptable:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[[package]]
requests = {git = "git://${USERNAME}:${PASSWORD}@private.git.com/psf/requests.git", ref = "2.22.0"}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Keep in mind that environment variables are expanded in runtime, leaving the entries in \fBPipfile\fP or \fBPipfile.lock\fP untouched. This is to avoid the accidental leakage of credentials in the source code.
.SS ☤ Specifying Basically Anything
.sp
If you\(aqd like to specify that a specific package only be installed on certain systems,
you can use \fI\%PEP 508 specifiers\fP to accomplish this.
.sp
Here\(aqs an example \fBPipfile\fP, which will only install \fBpywinusb\fP on Windows systems:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp

.SS ☤ Using pipenv for Deployments
.sp
You may want to use \fBpipenv\fP as part of a deployment process.
.sp
You can enforce that your \fBPipfile.lock\fP is up to date using the \fB\-\-deploy\fP flag:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ pipenv install \-\-deploy
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This will fail a build if the \fBPipfile.lock\fP is out–of–date, instead of generating a new one.
.sp
Or you can install packages exactly as specified in \fBPipfile.lock\fP using the \fBsync\fP command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ pipenv sync
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBpipenv install \-\-ignore\-pipfile\fP is nearly equivalent to \fBpipenv sync\fP, but \fBpipenv sync\fP will \fInever\fP attempt to re\-lock your dependencies as it is considered an atomic operation.  \fBpipenv install\fP by default does attempt to re\-lock unless using the \fB\-\-deploy\fP flag.

Django before 1.8.x before 1.8.16, 1.9.x before 1.9.11, and 1.10.x before 1.10.3, when settings.DEBUG is True, allow remote attackers to conduct DNS rebinding attacks by leveraging failure to validate the HTTP Host header against settings.ALLOWED_HOSTS.

Django 1.8.x before 1.8.16, 1.9.x before 1.9.11, and 1.10.x before 1.10.3 use a hardcoded password for a temporary database user created when running tests with an Oracle database, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain access to the database server by leveraging failure to manually specify a password in the database settings TEST dictionary.

CVE\-2017\-7233: Open redirect and possible XSS attack via user\-supplied numeric redirect URLs
============================================================================================

Django relies on user input in some cases  (e.g.
:func:\(gadjango.contrib.auth.views.login\(ga and :doc:\(gai18n </topics/i18n/index>\(ga)
to redirect the user to an "on success" URL. The security check for these
redirects (namely \(ga\(gadjango.utils.http.is_safe_url()\(ga\(ga) considered some numeric
URLs (e.g. \(ga\(gahttp:999999999\(ga\(ga) "safe" when they shouldn\(aqt be.

Also, if a developer relies on \(ga\(gais_safe_url()\(ga\(ga to provide safe redirect
targets and puts such a URL into a link, they could suffer from an XSS attack.

CVE\-2017\-7234: Open redirect vulnerability in \(ga\(gadjango.views.static.serve()\(ga\(ga
=============================================================================

A maliciously crafted URL to a Django site using the
:func:\(ga~django.views.static.serve\(ga view could redirect to any other domain. The
view no longer does any redirects as they don\(aqt provide any known, useful
functionality.

Note, however, that this view has always carried a warning that it is not
hardened for production use and should be used only as a development aid.

If you\(aqd like to set these environment variables on a per\-project basis, I recommend utilizing the fantastic \fI\%direnv\fP project, in order to do so.
.sp
Also note that \fI\%pip itself supports environment variables\fP, if you need additional customization.
.sp
For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ PIP_INSTALL_OPTION="\-\- \-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release" pipenv install \-e .
.ft P

.SS ☤ Custom Virtual Environment Location
.sp
Pipenv automatically honors the \fBWORKON_HOME\fP environment variable, if you
have it set —\ so you can tell pipenv to store your virtual environments
wherever you want, e.g.:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
export WORKON_HOME=~/.venvs
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In addition, you can also have Pipenv stick the virtualenv in \fBproject/.venv\fP by setting the \fBPIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT\fP environment variable.
.SS ☤ Testing Projects
.sp
Pipenv is being used in projects like \fI\%Requests\fP for declaring development dependencies and running the test suite.
.sp
We have currently tested deployments with both \fI\%Travis\-CI\fP and \fI\%tox\fP with success.
.SS Travis CI
.sp
An example Travis CI setup can be found in \fI\%Requests\fP\&. The project uses a Makefile to
define common functions such as its \fBinit\fP and \fBtests\fP commands. Here is
a stripped down example \fB\&.travis.yml\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
language: python
python:
    \- "2.6"
    \- "2.7"
    \- "3.3"
    \- "3.4"
    \- "3.5"
    \- "3.6"
    \- "3.7\-dev"

# command to install dependencies
install: "make"

# command to run tests
script:
    \- make test
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
and the corresponding Makefile:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
init:
    pip install pipenv
    pipenv install \-\-dev

test:
    pipenv run pytest tests
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Tox Automation Project
.sp
Alternatively, you can configure a \fBtox.ini\fP like the one below for both local
and external testing:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[tox]
envlist = flake8\-py3, py26, py27, py33, py34, py35, py36, pypy

[testenv]
deps = pipenv
commands=
    pipenv install \-\-dev
    pipenv run pytest tests

[testenv:flake8\-py3]
basepython = python3.4
commands=
    pipenv install \-\-dev
    pipenv run flake8 \-\-version
    pipenv run flake8 setup.py docs project test
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Pipenv will automatically use the virtualenv provided by \fBtox\fP\&. If \fBpipenv install \-\-dev\fP installs e.g. \fBpytest\fP, then installed command \fBpytest\fP will be present in given virtualenv and can be called directly by \fBpytest tests\fP instead of \fBpipenv run pytest tests\fP\&.
.sp
You might also want to add \fB\-\-ignore\-pipfile\fP to \fBpipenv install\fP, as to
not accidentally modify the lock\-file on each test run. This causes Pipenv
to ignore changes to the \fBPipfile\fP and (more importantly) prevents it from
adding the current environment to \fBPipfile.lock\fP\&. This might be important as
the current environment (i.e. the virtualenv provisioned by tox) will usually
contain the current project (which may or may not be desired) and additional
dependencies from \fBtox\fP\(aqs \fBdeps\fP directive. The initial provisioning may
alternatively be disabled by adding \fBskip_install = True\fP to tox.ini.
.sp
This method requires you to be explicit about updating the lock\-file, which is
probably a good idea in any case.
.sp
A 3rd party plugin, \fI\%tox\-pipenv\fP is also available to use Pipenv natively with tox.
.SS ☤ Shell Completion
.sp
To enable completion in fish, add this to your configuration:

.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf

.SS ☤ Working with Platform\-Provided Python Components
.sp
It\(aqs reasonably common for platform specific Python bindings for
operating system interfaces to only be available through the system
package manager, and hence unavailable for installation into virtual
environments with \fIpip\fP\&. In these cases, the virtual environment can
be created with access to the system \fIsite\-packages\fP directory:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ pipenv \-\-three \-\-site\-packages
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To ensure that all \fIpip\fP\-installable components actually are installed
into the virtual environment and system packages are only used for
interfaces that don\(aqt participate in Python\-level dependency resolution
at all, use the \fIPIP_IGNORE_INSTALLED\fP setting:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ PIP_IGNORE_INSTALLED=1 pipenv install \-\-dev
.ft P

.SS ☤ Pipfile vs setup.py
.sp
There is a subtle but very important distinction to be made between \fBapplications\fP and \fBlibraries\fP\&. This is a very common source of confusion in the Python community.
.sp
Libraries provide reusable functionality to other libraries and applications (let\(aqs use the umbrella term \fBprojects\fP here). They are required to work alongside other libraries, all with their own set of sub\-dependencies. They define \fBabstract dependencies\fP\&. To avoid version conflicts in sub\-dependencies of different libraries within a project, libraries should never ever pin dependency versions. Although they may specify lower or (less frequently) upper bounds, if they rely on some specific feature/fix/bug. Library dependencies are specified via \fBinstall_requires\fP in \fBsetup.py\fP\&.
.sp
Libraries are ultimately meant to be used in some \fBapplication\fP\&. Applications are different in that they usually are not depended on by other projects. They are meant to be deployed into some specific environment and only then should the exact versions of all their dependencies and sub\-dependencies be made concrete. To make this process easier is currently the main goal of Pipenv.
.sp
To summarize:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
For libraries, define \fBabstract dependencies\fP via \fBinstall_requires\fP in \fBsetup.py\fP\&. The decision of which version exactly to be installed and where to obtain that dependency is not yours to make!
.IP \(bu 2
For applications, define \fBdependencies and where to get them\fP in the \fIPipfile\fP and use this file to update the set of \fBconcrete dependencies\fP in \fBPipfile.lock\fP\&. This file defines a specific idempotent environment that is known to work for your project. The \fBPipfile.lock\fP is your source of truth. The \fBPipfile\fP is a convenience for you to create that lock\-file, in that it allows you to still remain somewhat vague about the exact version of a dependency to be used. Pipenv is there to help you define a working conflict\-free set of specific dependency\-versions, which would otherwise be a very tedious task.
.IP \(bu 2
Of course, \fBPipfile\fP and Pipenv are still useful for library developers, as they can be used to define a development or test environment.
.IP \(bu 2
And, of course, there are projects for which the distinction between library and application isn\(aqt that clear. In that case, use \fBinstall_requires\fP alongside Pipenv and \fBPipfile\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can also do this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ pipenv install \-e .
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This will tell Pipenv to lock all your \fBsetup.py\fP–declared dependencies.
.SS ☤ Changing Pipenv\(aqs Cache Location
.sp
You can force Pipenv to use a different cache location by setting the environment variable \fBPIPENV_CACHE_DIR\fP to the location you wish. This is useful in the same situations that you would change \fBPIP_CACHE_DIR\fP to a different directory.
.SS ☤ Changing Default Python Versions
.sp
By default, Pipenv will initialize a project using whatever version of python the python3 is. Besides starting a project with the \fB\-\-three\fP or \fB\-\-two\fP flags, you can also use \fBPIPENV_DEFAULT_PYTHON_VERSION\fP to specify what version to use when starting a project when \fB\-\-three\fP or \fB\-\-two\fP aren\(aqt used.
.SS Pipenv CLI Reference
.SS Frequently Encountered Pipenv Problems
.sp
Pipenv is constantly being improved by volunteers, but is still a very young
project with limited resources, and has some quirks that needs to be dealt
with. We need everyone’s help (including yours!).
.sp
Here are some common questions people have using Pipenv. Please take a look
below and see if they resolve your problem.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBMake sure you’re running the newest Pipenv version first!\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS ☤ Your dependencies could not be resolved
.sp
Make sure your dependencies actually \fIdo\fP resolve. If you’re confident they
are, you may need to clear your resolver cache. Run the following command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
pipenv lock \-\-clear
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
and try again.
.sp
If this does not work, try manually deleting the whole cache directory. It is
usually one of the following locations:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB~/Library/Caches/pipenv\fP (macOS)
.IP \(bu 2
\fB%LOCALAPPDATA%\epipenv\epipenv\eCache\fP (Windows)
.IP \(bu 2
\fB~/.cache/pipenv\fP (other operating systems)
.UNINDENT
.sp
Pipenv does not install pre\-releases (i.e. a version with an alpha/beta/etc.
suffix, such as \fI1.0b1\fP) by default. You will need to pass the \fB\-\-pre\fP flag
in your command, or set
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[pipenv]
allow_prereleases = true
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
in your Pipfile.
.SS ☤ No module named <module name>
.sp
This is usually a result of mixing Pipenv with system packages. We \fIstrongly\fP
recommend installing Pipenv in an isolated environment. Uninstall all existing
Pipenv installations, and see installing\-pipenv to choose one of the
recommended way to install Pipenv instead.
.SS ☤ My pyenv\-installed Python is not found
.sp
Make sure you have \fBPYENV_ROOT\fP set correctly. Pipenv only supports CPython
distributions, with version name like \fB3.6.4\fP or similar.
.SS ☤ Pipenv does not respect pyenv’s global and local Python versions
.sp
Pipenv by default uses the Python it is installed against to create the
virtualenv. You can set the \fB\-\-python\fP option to \fB$(pyenv which python)\fP
to use your current pyenv interpreter. See specifying_versions for more
information.
.SS ☤ ValueError: unknown locale: UTF\-8
.sp
macOS has a bug in its locale detection that prevents us from detecting your
shell encoding correctly. This can also be an issue on other systems if the
locale variables do not specify an encoding.
.sp
The workaround is to set the following two environment variables to a standard
localization format:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBLC_ALL\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBLANG\fP
.UNINDENT

.UNINDENT
.SS ☤ /bin/pip: No such file or directory
.sp
This may be related to your locale setting. See \fI\%☤ ValueError: unknown locale: UTF\-8\fP
for a possible solution.
.SS ☤ Pipenv does not respect dependencies in setup.py
.sp
No, it does not, intentionally. Pipfile and setup.py serve different purposes,
and should not consider each other by default. See pipfile\-vs\-setuppy
for more information.
.SS ☤ Using \fBpipenv run\fP in Supervisor program
.sp
When you configure a supervisor program\(aqs \fBcommand\fP with \fBpipenv run ...\fP, you
need to set locale environment variables properly to make it work.
.sp
Add this line under \fB[supervisord]\fP section in \fB/etc/supervisor/supervisord.conf\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[supervisord]

.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS ☤ An exception is raised during \fBLocking dependencies...\fP
.sp
Run \fBpipenv lock \-\-clear\fP and try again. The lock sequence caches results
to speed up subsequent runs. The cache may contain faulty results if a bug
causes the format to corrupt, even after the bug is fixed. \fB\-\-clear\fP flushes
the cache, and therefore removes the bad results.

If you\(aqre reading this, you\(aqre probably interested in contributing to Pipenv.
Thank you very much! Open source projects live\-and\-die based on the support
they receive from others, and the fact that you\(aqre even considering
contributing to the Pipenv project is \fIvery\fP generous of you.
.sp
This document lays out guidelines and advice for contributing to this project.
If you\(aqre thinking of contributing, please start by reading this document and
getting a feel for how contributing to this project works. If you have any
questions, feel free to reach out to either \fI\%Dan Ryan\fP, \fI\%Tzu\-ping Chung\fP,
or \fI\%Nate Prewitt\fP, the primary maintainers.
.sp
The guide is split into sections based on the type of contribution you\(aqre
thinking of making, with a section that covers general guidelines for all
contributors.
.SS General Guidelines
.SS Be Cordial
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBBe cordial or be on your way\fP\&. \fI—Kenneth Reitz\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Pipenv has one very important rule governing all forms of contribution,
including reporting bugs or requesting features. This golden rule is
"\fI\%be cordial or be on your way\fP".
.sp
\fBAll contributions are welcome\fP, as long as
everyone involved is treated with respect.
.SS Get Early Feedback
.sp
If you are contributing, do not feel the need to sit on your contribution until
it is perfectly polished and complete. It helps everyone involved for you to
seek feedback as early as you possibly can. Submitting an early, unfinished
version of your contribution for feedback in no way prejudices your chances of
getting that contribution accepted, and can save you from putting a lot of work
into a contribution that is not suitable for the project.
.SS Contribution Suitability
.sp
Our project maintainers have the last word on whether or not a contribution is
suitable for Pipenv. All contributions will be considered carefully, but from
time to time, contributions will be rejected because they do not suit the
current goals or needs of the project.
.sp
If your contribution is rejected, don\(aqt despair! As long as you followed these
guidelines, you will have a much better chance of getting your next
contribution accepted.
.SS Questions
.sp
The GitHub issue tracker is for \fIbug reports\fP and \fIfeature requests\fP\&. Please do
not use it to ask questions about how to use Pipenv. These questions should
instead be directed to \fI\%Stack Overflow\fP\&. Make sure that your question is tagged
with the \fBpipenv\fP tag when asking it on Stack Overflow, to ensure that it is
answered promptly and accurately.
.SS Code Contributions
.SS Steps for Submitting Code
.sp
When contributing code, you\(aqll want to follow this checklist:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Understand our \fI\%development philosophy\fP\&.
.IP 2. 3
Fork the repository on GitHub.
.IP 3. 3
Set up your \fI\%Development Setup\fP
.IP 4. 3
Run the tests (\fI\%Testing\fP) to confirm they all pass on your system.
If they don\(aqt, you\(aqll need to investigate why they fail. If you\(aqre unable
to diagnose this yourself, raise it as a bug report by following the guidelines
in this document: \fI\%Bug Reports\fP\&.
.IP 5. 3
Write tests that demonstrate your bug or feature. Ensure that they fail.
.IP 6. 3
Make your change.
.IP 7. 3
Run the entire test suite again, confirming that all tests pass \fIincluding
the ones you just added\fP\&.
.IP 8. 3
Send a GitHub Pull Request to the main repository\(aqs \fBmaster\fP branch.
GitHub Pull Requests are the expected method of code collaboration on this
project.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The following sub\-sections go into more detail on some of the points above.
.SS Development Setup
.sp
To get your development environment setup, run:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
pip install \-e .
pipenv install \-\-dev
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This will install the repository version of Pipenv and then install the development
dependencies. Once that has completed, you can start developing.
.sp
The repository version of Pipenv must be installed over other global versions to
resolve conflicts with the \fBpipenv\fP folder being implicitly added to \fBsys.path\fP\&.
See \fI\%pypa/pipenv#2557\fP for more details.
.SS Testing
.sp
Tests are written in \fBpytest\fP style and can be run very simply:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
pytest
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This will run all Pipenv tests, which can take awhile. To run a subset of the
tests, the standard pytest filters are available, such as:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
provide a directory or file: \fBpytest tests/unit\fP or \fBpytest tests/unit/test_cmdparse.py\fP
.IP \(bu 2
provide a keyword expression: \fBpytest \-k test_lock_editable_vcs_without_install\fP
.IP \(bu 2
provide a nodeid: \fBpytest tests/unit/test_cmdparse.py::test_parse\fP
.IP \(bu 2
provide a test marker: \fBpytest \-m lock\fP
.UNINDENT
.SS Code Review
.sp
Contributions will not be merged until they have been code reviewed. You should
implement any code review feedback unless you strongly object to it. In the
event that you object to the code review feedback, you should make your case
clearly and calmly. If, after doing so, the feedback is judged to still apply,
you must either apply the feedback or withdraw your contribution.
.SS Package Index
.sp
To speed up testing, tests that rely on a package index for locking and
installing use a local server that contains vendored packages in the
\fBtests/pypi\fP directory. Each vendored package should have it\(aqs own folder
containing the necessary releases. When adding a release for a package, it is
easiest to use either the \fB\&.tar.gz\fP or universal wheels (ex: \fBpy2.py3\-none\fP). If
a \fB\&.tar.gz\fP or universal wheel is not available, add wheels for all available
architectures and platforms.
.SS Documentation Contributions
.sp
Documentation improvements are always welcome! The documentation files live in
the \fBdocs/\fP directory of the codebase. They\(aqre written in
\fI\%reStructuredText\fP, and use \fI\%Sphinx\fP to generate the full suite of
documentation.
.sp
When contributing documentation, please do your best to follow the style of the
documentation files. This means a soft\-limit of 79 characters wide in your text
files and a semi\-formal, yet friendly and approachable, prose style.
.sp
When presenting Python code, use single\-quoted strings (\fB\(aqhello\(aq\fP instead of
\fB"hello"\fP).
.SS Bug Reports
.sp
Bug reports are hugely important! They are recorded as \fI\%GitHub issues\fP\&. Please
be aware of the following things when filing bug reports:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Avoid raising duplicate issues. \fIPlease\fP use the GitHub issue search feature
to check whether your bug report or feature request has been mentioned in
the past. Duplicate bug reports and feature requests are a huge maintenance
burden on the limited resources of the project. If it is clear from your
report that you would have struggled to find the original, that\(aqs okay, but
if searching for a selection of words in your issue title would have found
the duplicate then the issue will likely be closed extremely abruptly.
.IP 2. 3
When filing bug reports about exceptions or tracebacks, please include the
\fIcomplete\fP traceback. Partial tracebacks, or just the exception text, are
not helpful. Issues that do not contain complete tracebacks may be closed
without warning.
.IP 3. 3
Make sure you provide a suitable amount of information to work with. This
means you should provide:
.INDENT 3.0
.IP \(bu 2
Guidance on \fBhow to reproduce the issue\fP\&. Ideally, this should be a
\fIsmall\fP code sample that can be run immediately by the maintainers.
Failing that, let us know what you\(aqre doing, how often it happens, what
environment you\(aqre using, etc. Be thorough: it prevents us needing to ask
further questions.
.IP \(bu 2
Tell us \fBwhat you expected to happen\fP\&. When we run your example code,
what are we expecting to happen? What does "success" look like for your
code?
.IP \(bu 2
Tell us \fBwhat actually happens\fP\&. It\(aqs not helpful for you to say "it
doesn\(aqt work" or "it fails". Tell us \fIhow\fP it fails: do you get an
exception? A hang? The packages installed seem incorrect?
How was the actual result different from your expected result?
.IP \(bu 2
Tell us \fBwhat version of Pipenv you\(aqre using\fP, and
\fBhow you installed it\fP\&. Different versions of Pipenv behave
differently and have different bugs, and some distributors of Pipenv
ship patches on top of the code we supply.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you do not provide all of these things, it will take us much longer to
fix your problem. If we ask you to clarify these and you never respond, we
will close your issue without fixing it.
.UNINDENT
.SS Run the tests
.sp
Three ways of running the tests are as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
\fBmake test\fP (which uses \fBdocker\fP)
.IP 2. 3
\fB\&./run\-tests.sh\fP or \fBrun\-tests.bat\fP
