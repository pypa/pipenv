\fBPipenv\fP —\ the officially recommended Python packaging tool from \fI\%Python.org\fP, free (as in freedom).
.sp
Pipenv is a tool that aims to bring the best of all packaging worlds (bundler, composer, npm, cargo, yarn, etc.) to the Python world. \fIWindows is a first-class citizen, in our world.\fP
.sp
It automatically creates and manages a virtualenv for your projects, as well as adds/removes packages from your \fBPipfile\fP as you install/uninstall packages. It also generates the ever-important \fBPipfile.lock\fP, which is used to produce deterministic builds.
.sp
The problems that Pipenv seeks to solve are multi\-faceted:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
You no longer need to use \fBpip\fP and \fBvirtualenv\fP separately. They work together.
.IP \(bu 2
Managing a \fBrequirements.txt\fP file \fI\%can be problematic\fP, so Pipenv uses the upcoming \fBPipfile\fP and \fBPipfile.lock\fP instead, which is superior for basic use cases.
.IP \(bu 2
Hashes are used everywhere, always. Security. Automatically expose security vulnerabilities.
.IP \(bu 2
Give you insight into your dependency graph (e.g. \fB$ pipenv graph\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Streamline development workflow by loading \fB\&.env\fP files.

.SS Pipenv & Virtual Environments
[image]
.sp
This tutorial walks you through installing and using Python packages.
.sp
It will show you how to install and use the necessary tools and make strong
recommendations on best practices. Keep in mind that Python is used for a great
many different purposes, and precisely how you want to manage your dependencies
may change based on how you decide to publish your software. The guidance
presented here is most directly applicable to the development and deployment of
network services (including web applications), but is also very well suited to
managing development and testing environments for any kind of project.

.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ python \-\-version
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

If you installed Python from source, with an installer from \fI\%python.org\fP, or
via \fI\%Homebrew\fP you should already have pip9. If you\(aqre on Linux and installed
using your OS package manager, you may have to \fI\%install pip\fP separately.
.SS ☤ Installing Pipenv
.sp
Pipenv is a dependency manager for Python projects. If you\(aqre familiar
with Node.js\(aq \fI\%npm\fP or Ruby\(aqs \fI\%bundler\fP, it is similar in spirit to those
tools. While pip can install Python packages, Pipenv is recommended as
it\(aqs a higher\-level tool that simplifies dependency management for common use
cases.
.sp
Use \fBpip\fP to install Pipenv:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ pip install \-\-user pipenv
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP

.INDENT 3.5
This does a \fI\%user installation\fP to prevent breaking any system\-wide
packages. If \fBpipenv\fP isn\(aqt available in your shell after installation,
you\(aqll need to add the \fI\%user base\fP\(aqs binary directory to your \fBPATH\fP\&.
.sp
On Linux and macOS you can find the user base binary directory by running
\fBpython \-m site \-\-user\-base\fP and adding \fBbin\fP to the end. For example,
this will typically print \fB~/.local\fP (with \fB~\fP expanded to the
absolute path to your home directory) so you\(aqll need to add
\fB~/.local/bin\fP to your \fBPATH\fP\&. You can set your \fBPATH\fP permanently by
\fI\%modifying ~/.profile\fP\&.
.sp
On Windows you can find the user base binary directory by running
\fBpy \-m site \-\-user\-site\fP and replacing \fBsite\-packages\fP with
\fBScripts\fP\&. For example, this could return
\fBC:\eUsers\eUsername\eAppData\eRoaming\ePython36\esite\-packages\fP so you would
need to set your \fBPATH\fP to include
\fBC:\eUsers\eUsername\eAppData\eRoaming\ePython36\eScripts\fP\&. You can set your
user \fBPATH\fP permanently in the \fI\%Control Panel\fP\&. You may need to log
out for the \fBPATH\fP changes to take effect.

.SS ☤ Installing packages for your project
.sp
Pipenv manages dependencies on a per\-project basis. To install packages,
change into your project\(aqs directory (or just an empty directory for this
tutorial) and run:

.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ cd myproject
$ pipenv install requests
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Pipenv will install the excellent \fI\%Requests\fP library and create a \fBPipfile\fP
for you in your project\(aqs directory. The Pipfile is used to track which
dependencies your project needs in case you need to re\-install them, such as
when you share your project with others. You should get output similar to this
(although the exact paths shown will vary):

This will install both \fBpipenv\fP and \fBpew\fP (one of our dependencies) in an isolated virtualenv, so it doesn\(aqt interfere with the rest of your Python installation!
.SS ☤ Pragmatic Installation of Pipenv
.sp
If you have a working installation of pip, and maintain certain "toolchain" type Python modules as global utilities in your user environment, pip \fI\%user installs\fP allow for installation into your home directory. Note that due to interaction between dependencies, you should limit tools installed in this way to basic building blocks for a Python workflow like virtualenv, pipenv, tox, and similar software.

.SS ☤ Importing from requirements.txt
.sp
If you only have a \fBrequirements.txt\fP file available when running \fBpipenv install\fP,
pipenv will automatically import the contents of this file and create a \fBPipfile\fP for you.
.sp
You can also specify \fB$ pipenv install \-r path/to/requirements.txt\fP to import a requirements file.
.sp
Note, that when importing a requirements file, they often have version numbers pinned, which you likely won\(aqt want
in your \fBPipfile\fP, so you\(aqll have to manually update your \fBPipfile\fP afterwards to reflect this.
.SS ☤ Specifying Versions of a Package

When given a Python version, like this, Pipenv will automatically scan your system for a Python that matches that given version.
.sp
If a \fBPipfile\fP hasn\(aqt been created yet, one will be created for you, that looks like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C

python_version = "3.6"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note the inclusion of \fB[requires] python_version = "3.6"\fP\&. This specifies that your application requires this version
of Python, and will be used automatically when running \fBpipenv install\fP against this \fBPipfile\fP in the future
(e.g. on other machines). If this is not true, feel free to simply remove this section.
.sp
If you don\(aqt specify a Python version on the command-line, either the \fB[requires]\fP \fBpython_full_version\fP or \fBpython_version\fP will be selected
automatically, falling back to whatever your system\(aqs default \fBpython\fP installation is, at time of execution.
.SS ☤ Editable Dependencies (e.g. \fB\-e .\fP )
.sp
You can tell Pipenv to install a path as editable — often this is useful for
the current working directory when working on packages:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ pipenv install \(aq\-e .\(aq \-\-dev

$ cat Pipfile
[dev\-packages]
"e1839a8" = {path = ".", editable = true}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that all sub\-dependencies will get added to the \fBPipfile.lock\fP as well.
.SS ☤ Environment Management with Pipenv
.sp
The three primary commands you\(aqll use in managing your pipenv environment are
\fB$ pipenv install\fP, \fB$ pipenv uninstall\fP, and \fB$ pipenv lock\fP\&.
.SS $ pipenv install
.sp
\fB$ pipenv install\fP is used for installing packages into the pipenv virtual environment
and updating your Pipfile.
.sp
Along with the basic install command, which takes the form:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ pipenv install [package names]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The user can provide these additional parameters:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-two\fP — Performs the installation in a virtualenv using the system \fBpython2\fP link.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-three\fP — Performs the installation in a virtualenv using the system \fBpython3\fP link.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-python\fP — Performs the installation in a virtualenv using the provided Python interpreter.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
None of the above commands should be used together. They are also
\fBdestructive\fP and will delete your current virtualenv before replacing
it with an appropriately versioned one.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The virtualenv created by Pipenv may be different from what you were expecting.
Dangerous characters (i.e. \fB$\(ga!*@"\fP as well as space, line feed, carriage return,
and tab) are converted to underscores. Additionally, the full path to the current
folder is encoded into a "slug value" and appended to ensure the virtualenv name
is unique.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-dev\fP — Install both \fBdevelop\fP and \fBdefault\fP packages from \fBPipfile.lock\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-system\fP — Use the system \fBpip\fP command rather than the one from your virtualenv.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-ignore\-pipfile\fP — Ignore the \fBPipfile\fP and install from the \fBPipfile.lock\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-skip\-lock\fP — Ignore the \fBPipfile.lock\fP and install from the \fBPipfile\fP\&. In addition, do not write out a \fBPipfile.lock\fP reflecting changes to the \fBPipfile\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS $ pipenv uninstall
.sp
\fB$ pipenv uninstall\fP supports all of the parameters in \fI\%pipenv install\fP,
as well as one additional, \fB\-\-all\fP\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-all\fP — This parameter will purge all files from the virtual environment,
but leave the Pipfile untouched.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS $ pipenv lock
.sp
\fB$ pipenv lock\fP is used to create a \fBPipfile.lock\fP, which declares \fBall\fP dependencies (and sub\-dependencies) of your project, their latest available versions, and the current hashes for the downloaded files. This ensures repeatable, and most importantly \fIdeterministic\fP, builds.
.SS ☤ About Shell Configuration
.sp
Shells are typically misconfigured for subshell use, so \fB$ pipenv shell \-\-fancy\fP may produce unexpected results. If this is the case, try \fB$ pipenv shell\fP, which uses "compatibility mode", and will attempt to spawn a subshell despite misconfiguration.
.sp
A proper shell configuration only sets environment variables like \fBPATH\fP during a login session, not during every subshell spawn (as they are typically configured to do). In fish, this looks like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
if status \-\-is\-login
    set \-gx PATH /usr/local/bin $PATH
end
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You should do this for your shell too, in your \fB~/.profile\fP or \fB~/.bashrc\fP or wherever appropriate.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The shell launched in interactive mode. This means that if your shell reads its configuration from a specific file for interactive mode (e.g. bash by default looks for a \fB~/.bashrc\fP configuration file for interactive mode), then you\(aqll need to modify (or create) this file.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS ☤ A Note about VCS Dependencies
.sp
Pipenv will resolve the sub-dependencies of VCS dependencies, but only if they are editable, like so:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[packages]
requests = {git = "https://github.com/requests/requests.git", editable=true}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If editable is not true, sub-dependencies will not get resolved.
.SS ☤ Pipfile.lock Security Features
.sp
\fBPipfile.lock\fP takes advantage of some great new security improvements in \fBpip\fP\&.
By default, the \fBPipfile.lock\fP will be generated with the sha256 hashes of each downloaded
package. This will allow \fBpip\fP to guarantee you\(aqre installing what you intend to when
on a compromised network, or downloading dependencies from an untrusted PyPI endpoint.
.sp
We highly recommend approaching deployments with promoting projects from a development
environment into production. You can use \fBpipenv lock\fP to compile your dependencies on
your development environment and deploy the compiled \fBPipfile.lock\fP to all of your
production environments for reproducible builds.
.SS Advanced Usage of Pipenv
[image]
.sp
This document covers some of Pipenv\(aqs more glorious and advanced features.
.SS ☤ Specifying Package Indexes
.sp
If you\(aqd like a specific package to be installed with a specific package index, you can do the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[[source]]
url = "https://pypi.python.org/simple"

.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Very fancy.
.SS ☤ Specifying Basically Anything
.sp
If you\(aqd like to specify that a specific package only be installed on certain systems,
you can use \fI\%PEP 508 specifiers\fP to accomplish this.
.sp
Here\(aqs an example \fBPipfile\fP, which will only install \fBpywinusb\fP on Windows systems:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[[source]]
url = "https://pypi.python.org/simple"

Magic. Pure, unadulterated magic.
.SS ☤ Deploying System Dependencies
.sp
You can tell Pipenv to install things into its parent system with the \fB\-\-system\fP flag:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ pipenv install \-\-system
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This is useful for Docker containers, and deployment infrastructure (e.g. Heroku does this).
.sp
Also useful for deployment is the \fB\-\-deploy\fP flag:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ pipenv install \-\-system \-\-deploy
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This will fail a build if the \fBPipfile.lock\fP is out-of-date, instead of generating a new one.
.SS ☤ Generating a \fBrequirements.txt\fP
.sp
You can convert a \fBPipfile\fP and \fBPipenv.lock\fP into a \fBrequirements.txt\fP file very easily, and get all the benefits of hashes, extras, and other goodies we have included.
.sp
Let\(aqs take this \fBPipfile\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp

url = "https://pypi.python.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true

Django before 1.8.x before 1.8.16, 1.9.x before 1.9.11, and 1.10.x before 1.10.3, when settings.DEBUG is True, allow remote attackers to conduct DNS rebinding attacks by leveraging failure to validate the HTTP Host header against settings.ALLOWED_HOSTS.

33076: django >=1.10,<1.10.3 resolved (1.10.1 installed)!
Django 1.8.x before 1.8.16, 1.9.x before 1.9.11, and 1.10.x before 1.10.3 use a hardcoded password for a temporary database user created when running tests with an Oracle database, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain access to the database server by leveraging failure to manually specify a password in the database settings TEST dictionary.

CVE\-2017\-7233: Open redirect and possible XSS attack via user\-supplied numeric redirect URLs
============================================================================================

Django relies on user input in some cases  (e.g.
:func:\(gadjango.contrib.auth.views.login\(ga and :doc:\(gai18n </topics/i18n/index>\(ga)
to redirect the user to an "on success" URL. The security check for these
redirects (namely \(ga\(gadjango.utils.http.is_safe_url()\(ga\(ga) considered some numeric
URLs (e.g. \(ga\(gahttp:999999999\(ga\(ga) "safe" when they shouldn\(aqt be.

Also, if a developer relies on \(ga\(gais_safe_url()\(ga\(ga to provide safe redirect
targets and puts such a URL into a link, they could suffer from an XSS attack.

CVE\-2017\-7234: Open redirect vulnerability in \(ga\(gadjango.views.static.serve()\(ga\(ga
=============================================================================

A maliciously crafted URL to a Django site using the
:func:\(ga~django.views.static.serve\(ga view could redirect to any other domain. The
view no longer does any redirects as they don\(aqt provide any known, useful
functionality.

Note, however, that this view has always carried a warning that it is not
hardened for production use and should be used only as a development aid.

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ pipenv \-\-three \-\-site\-packages
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To ensure that all \fIpip\fP\-installable components actually are installed
into the virtual environment and system packages are only used for
interfaces that don\(aqt participate in Python\-level dependency resolution
at all, use the \fIPIP_IGNORE_INSTALLED\fP setting:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ PIP_IGNORE_INSTALLED=1 pipenv install \-\-dev
.ft P
.fi
